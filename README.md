With the need to classify celestial beings being introduced, there arises an issue addressing the procedure to be executed for achieving this goal.
Not every celestial being's data will be used for the classifying, therefore, the satellite images used must be manually studied to process data. Inevitably, we're provided with a situation of inefficiency and high time-consumption.
There have been multiple attempts in respect to the situation and the researchers had come up with a suitable solution.However, the pace at which the procedures has been updated has always been slower compared to the techonological development. Presently, we find ourselves purplexed by the distribution of the new dataset dr-17 and how it can be implemented.

Observing an unexplored plethora of opportunities, we, as a team, have undertaken the task of inspecting the accuracy provided by the collected datasets to the sought-after problem of classification.By the means of implementation of five self-sufficient algorithms involved in Machine Learning, the research will be a comparative study between the accuracies provided by the selected algorithms with the datasets provided as inputs individually.Â The inferences will further be extended to highlight the trends which have changed in the interval of data update, and finally, the best suited algorithm, in terms of accuracy, will be chosen for the DR-17 dataset.
